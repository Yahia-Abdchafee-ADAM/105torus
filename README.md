<h2> Description </h2>

<p>Drawing circles, cylinders and cones is a good start for an image synthesis software, but one have to admit
it is not fully satisfying. . . This project is the continuation of the previous one, and should allow you to draw
more complex forms, such as a torus, which do not emerge from 2nd degree equations, but from superior
degree equations (4th degree in the torus case).</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation: a4x4 + a3x3 + a2x2 + a1x1 + a0 = 0. A direct
resolution method does exist (Ferrari’s method), but does not generalize to higher degrees. Thus, we will
rather compare 3 iterative algorithms:</p>

  - The bisection method,
  - Newton’s method,
  - The secant method.
